# ðŸŽ“ Printer_Management
### Printer and pending job manager program
This program works based on a file requested by command line with a list of printers. Using the queue and heap TADs it manages that list of printers.
When the program ends, the file is updated with the new list of printes.

Features:
- Add printers
- Delete printers
- Add jobs to those printers
- Print pending jobs (remove them)
- Show list of pending jobs
- Look for printers with less pending jobs
